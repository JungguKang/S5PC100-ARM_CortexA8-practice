# S5PC100-ARM_CortexA8-practice
This repository is about the projects that I had done in embedded system lecture in 2020.   
S5PC100 is a processor made in Samsung that is based on ARM Cortex-A8. 
I used the SYS-LAB 2 embedded board that contains the S5PC100 processor. This supports Embedded Linux and Google Android.
The projects were done sequentially, first porting operating system called VPOS 2.0 to S5PC100 processor.   
The next project is the second folder that I uploaded, the 7-segment.
This is kind of practice of using FPGA with the embedded board and designing using ISE simulator with verilog.   
Final project is vending machine project using the same environment with 7-segment project.
